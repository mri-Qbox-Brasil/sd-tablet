-- Main config - an index that stitches the per-group config files together, exactly like
-- sd-phone's. Every consumer does `require 'configs.config'` and reads the same table; to change
-- a group's settings, edit its own file in this folder.

-- The tablet deliberately has FAR fewer knobs than the phone. Everything that belongs to the
-- player rather than to the device - mail accounts, message limits, garages, banking, cell
-- towers, Wi-Fi, the app back-ends - stays configured in sd-phone and is reached through it, so
-- there is exactly one place to change any of it and the two devices can never disagree.
