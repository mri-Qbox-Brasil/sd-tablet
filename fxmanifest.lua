description 'In-game tablet: a second device running the sd-phone React bundle over sd-phone\'s own client and server layer. Shares every byte of player data with the phone - messages, mail, contacts, installed apps, settings - and can do everything the phone can except make or receive voice calls'

-- sd-phone is a hard dependency, not a soft one: every NUI action this device answers is one of
-- sd-phone's handlers, invoked across the companion seam. Without it the tablet is a blank frame.
-- NOT `provide 'lb-phone'` - sd-phone already claims that, and two providers of one name is a
-- start-order coin toss.
